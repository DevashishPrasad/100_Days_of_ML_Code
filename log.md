# 100 days of ML code
I have been working on Machine learning from last few weeks. And I came across the Siraj's Video to take up the pledge of 100 days of ML coding. I created this Reopository to mark my progress.

## Day 1

Today I started with the book "Data Science from scratch - first principles" by Joel Grus. I also revised some python syntax and watched 10-12 videos of Sentdex Python Intermediate.
