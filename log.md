# 100 days of ML code
I have been working on Machine learning from last few weeks. And I came across the Siraj's Video to take up the pledge of 100 days of ML coding. I created this Reopository to mark my progress.

## Day 1
### (7th July 2018 IST 15:54)

Today I started with the book "Data Science from scratch - first principles" by Joel Grus. I read first chapter which mostly gives introduction to data science. It also talks about some real time problem and their solutions. I also revised some python syntax and watched 10-12 videos of Sentdex Python Intermediate. I also got a video series on Machine learning by Andre NG. I will start the video series from tommorow.

## Day 2

Today I started with my first algorithm for machine learning. I saw Siraj Raval's Video about Linear Regression using gradient descent. I typed code along with him. But, i dont know why, his output and my output differ on the same dataset. I must have done something wrong. Then, I saw videos from Andrew NG about linear regression. He explained it in a different manner. His notations and explaination was different. But after 2-3 videos i figured it out that it was the same as explained by siraj. I dont think i can say i understood gradient descent 100% but i will keep trying to study and understand how to minimize cost using it. Tommorrow i will continue watching Andrew NG's videos and read next chapter from the book "Data Science from scratch - first principles" by Joel Grus.
